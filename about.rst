About the extension
========
Profanity Blocker is an extension based off of my Discord bot I have created which is also called Profanity Blocker!

On Discord, Profanity Blocker has been coded in Python3. For the chrome extension, I coded it in web design and Javascript.

The extension, Profanity-Blocker, has been created in late October of 2021 and will be free for a while.
