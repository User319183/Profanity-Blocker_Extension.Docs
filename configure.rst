What do the tabs mean?
========
When you are on the configuration settings of the extensions you might be confused on what some of the settings might mean. Let me explain!

**Settings** : The settings tab is the main tab for the configurations. You can choose the type of filter method, censoring the bad word means to edit it with symbols, 
substituting the bad word means to edit the bad word with it's closest meaning, and removing the bad word means to remove the bad word completely. 
You can choose the censor method of bad words, (the default is *) you can choose the match method, what this means is what part of the word do you want censored, 
you can add and/or remove your own words, when doing this, you can say if it has more types of meanings for that word, and last, you can view the word list.

**Words** : The words tab is the next tab. This tab just shows all the words in your word list. The numbers next to the words repreasents the amount of bad words 
on each website and the word count. You can view daily history, from a specfic date, and total amount.

**Ranks** : This tab shows all the websites you have been on and their profanity count. You can remove and/or add your own websites to the filter.

**Logs** : This tab shows all of the profanity sent and received.
