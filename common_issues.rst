Common issues found with Profanity Blocker
========
Issue: Password has been lost.

Solution: Please uninstall the extension and then reinstall it. You'll have to re-configure the extension.

Issue: Child uninstalls the extension

Solution: If your child uninstalls the extension, check their device every so often to make sure that the settings still work. Use your password
and see if going onto the settings will still work. If it doesn't and you are sure it's the right password, they uninstalled it and put a different password.
The punishment is not for me to decide. This is just how you can know if your child has been messing with the extension.

Issue: Computer lagging due to extension.

Solution: As of version 1.1, this will be a major issue until we come up with a proper solution. I would say to remove some of the 
`extra configurations <https://github.com/User319183/Profanity-Blocker_Extension.Docs/blob/main/configure.rst>`_. 
For example, one thing that boosts preformance is to change the **Site access** from **On all sites** to **On click**.
